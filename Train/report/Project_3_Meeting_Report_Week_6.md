# Team 1 Project 3 Week 5 Report

Participants:  Ziqi Gao, Tiansu Chen, Chenyang Zhang

Meeting Date:  2021. 4.2

Project Leader: Ziqi Gao

## Summary

Things finished since last meeting : Draw Class Diagram for Train project.

Ziqi Gao: Simplified the model. Draw class diagram.

Tiansu Chen: collaborate with S1.

Chenyang Zhang: collaborate with S1.

## Questions prepared for the instructor team

What is the command sent by the user? Does the user give us the time scheduling algorithm and we only need to visualize and check collision, delay time, and whether all locomotives reach destinations or not? Or, the command is a change in the environment, for example, a train is broken and need more time to repair. This means that we need to come up with a dynamic time scheduling algorithm.

## Action Items (Plan for the next week):

Ziqi Gao:  Refine Class Diagram and draw User Case Diagram. Prepare for the first consultant meeting.

Tiansu Chen:  Discuss and collaborate with Ziqi

Chenyang Zhang:  Discuss and collaborate with Ziqi
