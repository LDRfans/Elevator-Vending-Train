## Questions prepared for the instructor team

Can a user manually design his/her scheduling algorithm?

## Action Items (Plan for the next week):

Ziqi Gao:  Refine UML according to the development guy's advice. Draw sequence diagram.

Tiansu Chen: Help the requirement guy to refine the diagrams. Finish basic layout and visualization - better if we could deal with very simple input. (E.g 2 trains with no collision in schedule)

Chenyang Zhang:  Think about some simple input schedules.





Other random staff for memorization:

1. infinite trains at a station
2. only stop at station
3. assume only 0 - max speed first
4. 优先级规定, 3 Speed, GDK
5. + environment factor
6. 调度的内容：停留 + 速度

INPUT: 起点终点是否相同，Manually send command?
